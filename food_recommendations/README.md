## Discussion Questions

1. What happens with your solutions at scale? (n >>> 30). Is your problem still solvable?
Yes, the problem is still solveable if N refers to the number of food nodes in a graph. It becomes a bit more difficult when it's multi-component/multi-restaurant.
2. What is the time complexity of the algorithms you are using?
O((N*log(N))), N representing the max number of food ndoes.
